Welcome to visit my personal blog -  [Italkso](https://italkso.github.io).  

If you want to create an mobile app, here’s some [docs](https://italkso.github.io/xdocs) and [projects](https://italkso.github.io/project/project.html) for you.  

If you want to know more about Web Technologies, [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) is a good choice for you.

There are a lot of codes and notes. As far as I’m concerned, a bit will talk itself, so I just keep coding  & writing. Have a good time.
